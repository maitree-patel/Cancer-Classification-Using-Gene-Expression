# Cancer-Classification-Using-Gene-Expression
## Background
Leukemia is a cancer of blood, or more specifically blood forming tissues including bone marrow, that causes abnormality of blood cells. Many types of Leukemia exists characterised by the type of blood cell the cancer is localized in as well as its prognosis.

**Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)** is a cancer of the bone marrow. The bone marrow makes immature blood cells called blood stem cells which then form mature blood cells. The stem cell can become a myeloid or lymphoid stem cell eventually turning into mature red blood cells (or platelets) and white blood cells respectively.

## Main Aim
Using machine learning algorithms to perform assign acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) into classes using gene expression data.

Additionally, secondary goal of this project was to perform differential gene expression analysis.
