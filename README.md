# Cancer-Classification-Using-Gene-Expression
## Background
Leukemia is a cancer of blood, or more specifically blood forming tissues including bone marrow, that causes abnormality of blood cells. Many types of Leukemia exists characterised by the type of blood cell the cancer is localized in as well as its prognosis. The bone marrow makes immature blood cells called blood stem cells which then form mature blood cells. The stem cell can become a myeloid or lymphoid stem cell eventually turning into mature red blood cells (or platelets) and white blood cells respectively.

**Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)** is a cancer of the bone marrow. In AML, there are high number of immature RBCs called myeloblasts (leukemia cells). This also causes reduce amount of healthy WBCs and causes symptoms like anemia and bleeding.

In **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)** there is a large number of lymphoblast,B lymphocytes, or T lymphocytes production from lymphoid stem cells causing less room for health WBCs. ALL also causes similar symptoms as AML but can spread to the brain, spinal cord, liver and other organs.

Even though the two cancer are vastly similar in symptoms and diagnosis, they differ in the way the cancer is formed in itseld and in treatments including chemotherapy, meaintenance therapy and induction therapy to name a few. This means the two cancers can be distinguished based on gene expression due to difference in prognosis. Golub et al 1999 aimed to classify the two cancers based on molecular signatures in gene expression data. 

## Main Aim
The main aim of this analysis is to use machine learning algorithms to assign acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) into classes (
i.e. **class prediction**) using gene expression data.

Additionally, secondary goal of this project was to perform **differential gene expression analysis** to study the differences in gene expression between the two cancers.
